Basic template for machine learning using the MNIST dataset and sklearn. This
repo is heavily based on the book "Approaching (Almost) Any Machine Learning
Problem" by Abhishek Thakur.
(https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/approachingalmost)
Please check out his work, because the book is very well written and has been
the major influence for this project.

The goal is to create a basic template for approaching most ML problems, and
use the MNSIT dataset to make this a practical (and working) example. Because
the MNIST dataset is already cleaned and formatted, there is very little data
processing. The only thing is splitting the dataset into test and train splits
and then further dividing the training data into folds for validation.
